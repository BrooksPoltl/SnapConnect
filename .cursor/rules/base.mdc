# General Coding Best Practices

These are the core coding principles for all files in a React Native project using Expo and Firebase. They ensure clean, maintainable, and consistent code. For specific guidelines, refer to the following specialized rules:

- ([TypeScript Rules](mdc:.cursor/rules/typescript.mdc) for `.ts` and `.tsx` files.
- [Component Rules](mdc:.cursor/rules/component.mdc) for React Native components in `components/` or `screens/`.
- [Styling Rules](mdc:.cursor/rules/styling.mdc) for styles in `styles/` or style definitions.
- [Firebase Rules](mdc:.cursor/rules/firebase.mdc) for Firestore logic in `services/`.
- [PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md](mdc:PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md) for overall project context
- /feature_docs for a list of implemented feature plans and implementation steps

## Principles
- **Clean Code**: Write self-documenting code with meaningful names (e.g., `fetchUserData` instead of `getStuff`).
- **DRY**: Avoid duplication; extract reusable logic to hooks, utilities, or services.
- **KISS**: Keep solutions simple and focused; avoid over-engineering.
- **Single Responsibility**: Functions and components should do one thing well.
- **Consistency**: Use `camelCase` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for components/interfaces.

## Project Structure
- Organize code modularly:
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components.
  - `screens/`: Screen-specific components.
  - `hooks/`: Custom hooks.
  - `services/`: Firebase and API logic.
  - `utils/`: Helper functions, should follow functional programming principles, pure functions, avoiding reassignment.
  - `types/`: TypeScript interfaces.
  - `styles/`: Shared styles or themes.
- Use barrel files (`index.ts`) for simplified imports (e.g., `export * from './useAuth';`).

## Error Handling
- Wrap async operations in `try-catch` and display user-friendly errors.
- Use error boundaries for component rendering errors.
- Log errors to Sentry or Firebase Crashlytics via `expo-error-reporter`.

## Performance
- Memoize expensive computations with `useMemo` or `useCallback`.
- Use `FlatList` for lists with `initialNumToRender` for efficiency.
- Minimize Firestore reads/writes; use batched operations when possible.

## Documentation
- Document service calls and hooks with JSDoc or TypeScript comments.
- Maintain a `README.md` with setup instructions and Firebase configuration.

## Example
```tsx
// services/auth.ts
/**
 * Signs in a user with email and password
 * @param email - User's email
 * @param password - User's password
 * @returns User object or throws error
 */
export const signIn = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  try {
    const user = await auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error('Failed to sign in');
  }
};
```
## Logging

use the dedicated @logger.ts for logging, we should log all service calls for debugging purposes
