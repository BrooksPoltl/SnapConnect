# SnapConnect Financial Messenger

SnapConnect is a mobile-first social messaging application designed for the financial community. It combines the engaging, ephemeral nature of platforms like Snapchat with powerful, finance-specific tools, allowing users to share timely insights through disappearing photo and video messages.

The application allows users—from professional analysts to retail investors and students—to share timely insights, fostering a more informed and connected financial community.

## 1. Product Vision

### 1.1. The Problem
Financial news and analysis are scattered across platforms that are either too noisy (like Twitter) or too formal (like professional terminals). There is a need for a dedicated space where timely, digestible financial insights can be shared quickly among a trusted network.

### 1.2. Our Solution
SnapConnect provides a mobile-first platform for ephemeral, media-rich financial content. By creating a sense of urgency with disappearing messages and stories, it encourages daily engagement. A gamified user score motivates content creation, and planned AI tools will help creators generate accurate, data-driven content more efficiently.

### 1.3. Target Audience
- **Johnny (The Creator)**: A savvy retail investor who wants to share his market analysis and build a trusted community with tools that help him create unique, data-rich content.
- **Timmy (The Consumer)**: A finance student who wants to access exclusive, timely insights from trusted creators in an engaging and modern format.

## 2. Key Features

- **Ephemeral Messaging & Stories**: Send photo and video messages, or post stories to a public or private audience. All content is automatically deleted after 24 hours, creating a sense of urgency.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Engage in one-on-one text conversations with real-time message delivery, powered by Supabase Realtime.
- **Gamified User Score**: A simple and visible metric for engagement. Users gain points for creating content (+10 for a story, +5 for a message) to build their profile score and reputation.
- **Friend Management**: A full-featured social graph, allowing users to search by username, send/manage friend requests, and block users.
- **Simple AR Filters**: An MVP feature allowing users to overlay custom text (e.g., "$AAPL +5%") on their photo or video content.

## 3. Development Roadmap

The project is broken into two main phases:

### Phase 1: Core Social Messenger (Current)
- **Focus**: Build the foundational social features.
- **Includes**: User Authentication, Profiles, Friend Management, Real-Time Chat, Ephemeral Stories, and the User Score system.

### Phase 2: RAG-Enhanced Content Creation
- **Focus**: Introduce AI-powered tools to enrich content.
- **Includes**: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using official corporate filings (from EDGAR) and OpenAI to help users generate accurate, data-driven captions for their posts.

## 4. Technical Architecture

The application is built with a modern, scalable stack designed for real-time mobile experiences.

### 4.1. Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native (with Expo) and TypeScript.
- **Backend**: A full Supabase stack, including Auth, a Postgres Database, Storage, Realtime, and Deno-based Edge Functions.

### 4.2. Project Structure
The project follows a standard Expo project structure, with the core application logic located in the `src/` directory.

- `src/components`: Reusable UI components.
- `src/navigation`: Navigation logic, including stacks and routes.
- `src/screens`: Top-level screen components.
- `src/services`: Supabase client and interaction logic.
- `src/styles`: Theme, shared styles, and styling utilities.
- `src/types`: TypeScript type definitions.
- `src/utils`: Shared utilities and hooks.

### 4.3. Core Backend Logic
The backend is built around a secure and efficient data model.

- **Security Model (Row Level Security)**: The system is secure by default. RLS is enabled on all tables, and access is granted only through explicit policies that check a user's JWT (`auth.uid()`). For example, a user can only see a "private" story if they are an accepted friend of the author.
- **Content Expiration (Hybrid TTL)**: A two-part system ensures content disappears reliably.
    1.  **Instant Invisibility**: RLS policies instantly hide content older than 24 hours from all user queries.
    2.  **Permanent Deletion**: A scheduled Supabase Edge Function (`daily-cleanup`) runs once per day to permanently delete the expired data and associated media files from Storage.
- **Automated User Score**: The user score is updated automatically and efficiently using Postgres triggers. An `on insert` trigger on the `messages` and `stories` tables calls a database function (`update_user_score`) to increment the creator's score atomically.

## 5. Getting Started

### 5.1. Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS version)
- Yarn
- Expo Go app on your mobile device or a configured Android/iOS simulator.
- A Supabase project set up with the required database schema and RLS policies.

### 5.2. Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd SnapConnect
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Configure Supabase environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Supabase project URL and anon key:
    ```
    EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
    EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```
5.  **Run the app:**
    Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your device, or press `i` for the iOS Simulator or `a` for the Android Emulator.
