## 1. Product Vision

### 1.1. The Problem

Financial news and analysis are scattered across platforms that are either too
noisy (like Twitter) or too formal (like professional terminals). There is a
need for a dedicated space where timely, digestible financial insights can be
shared quickly among a trusted network.

### 1.2. Our Solution

SnapConnect provides a mobile-first platform for ephemeral, media-rich financial
content with **integrated AI-powered insights**. By creating a sense of urgency
with disappearing messages and stories, it encourages daily engagement. A
gamified user score motivates content creation, and **implemented AI tools**
help creators generate accurate, data-driven content more efficiently through
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology powered by SEC filings and
OpenAI.

### 1.3. Target Audience

- **Johnny (The Creator)**: A savvy retail investor who wants to share his
  market analysis and build a trusted community with tools that help him create
  unique, data-rich content.
- **Timmy (The Consumer)**: A finance student who wants to access exclusive,
  timely insights from trusted creators in an engaging and modern format.

### 5.3. Core Backend Logic

The backend is built around a secure and efficient data model.

- **Security Model (Row Level Security)**: The system is secure by default. RLS
  is enabled on all tables, and access is granted only through explicit policies
  that check a user's JWT (`auth.uid()`). For example, a user can only see a
  "private" story if they are an accepted friend of the author.
- **Content Expiration (Hybrid TTL)**: A two-part system ensures content
  disappears reliably.
  1.  **Instant Invisibility**: RLS policies instantly hide content older than
      24 hours from all user queries.
  2.  **Permanent Deletion**: A scheduled Supabase Edge Function
      (`daily-cleanup`) runs once per day to permanently delete the expired data
      and associated media files from Storage.
- **Automated User Score**: The user score is updated automatically and
  efficiently using Postgres triggers. An `on insert` trigger on the `messages`
  and `stories` tables calls a database function (`update_user_score`) to
  increment the creator's score atomically.

## 6. Getting Started

This guide covers how to set up and run the SnapConnect project on your local
machine for development and testing.

### 6.1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: LTS version (e.g., v18 or later)
- **Yarn**: For package management (`npm install -g yarn`)
- **Docker Desktop**: Must be running to host the local Supabase stack.
- **Supabase CLI**: For managing the local development environment
  (`brew install supabase/tap/supabase-cli` for macOS/Linux).
- **Expo Go**: The app on your mobile device (iOS or Android) or a configured
  local simulator.

### 6.2. Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to get the application and its backend services running
locally.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd SnapConnect
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start Local Backend Services:** This command starts the entire Supabase
    stack (database, auth, etc.) in Docker.

    ```sh
    supabase start
    ```

    The first time you run this, it will download the necessary Docker images
    and apply all database migrations located in `supabase/migrations`. On
    successful startup, the CLI will output your local Supabase `API URL` and
    `anon key`.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:** The application connects to Supabase
    using environment variables.
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root by copying the example file:
      ```sh
      cp env.example .env
      ```
    - Open the new `.env` file and fill in the local `API URL` and `anon key`
      provided by the `supabase start` command. It should look like this:
      ```env
      EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
      EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-local-anon-key-from-the-cli
      ```

5.  **Verify Your Setup:** Before running the application, validate your code:

    ```sh
    yarn prebuild
    ```

    This command runs type checking, formatting, and linting to ensure your code
    is ready for development.

6.  **Run the Application:** Start the Metro development server:

    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```

    **Network Troubleshooting:** If you encounter network connectivity issues:

    ```sh
    # Use tunnel connection for network issues (slower but more reliable)
    yarn start --tunnel

    # Clear Metro cache if experiencing build issues
    yarn start --clear

    # Combine both options if needed
    yarn start --tunnel --clear
    ```

7.  **Launch the App:**
    - Scan the QR code generated by Metro with the Expo Go app on your phone.
    - Or, press `i` to launch the iOS Simulator or `a` to launch the Android
      Emulator.

The app will now be running and connected to your local Supabase instance. Any
changes you make to the frontend code will reload automatically. If you make
changes to the backend (e.g., create a new database migration), you may need to
restart the Supabase services (`supabase stop` and `supabase start`).

### 6.3. Development Scripts

The project includes several helpful development scripts:

- **`yarn prebuild`**: Validates code quality (type checking, formatting,
  linting) - **always run this after making changes**
- **`yarn validate`**: Same as prebuild - ensures code quality before committing
- **`yarn lint`**: Run ESLint to check for code issues
- **`yarn lint:fix`**: Automatically fix linting issues where possible
- **`yarn format`**: Format code with Prettier
- **`yarn type-check`**: Run TypeScript compiler to check for type errors
- **`yarn start`**: Start development server with validation
- **`yarn ios`**: Run on iOS simulator with validation
- **`yarn android`**: Run on Android emulator with validation

### 6.4. Network Troubleshooting

If you encounter connectivity issues during development, Expo provides several
flags to resolve common problems:

#### `--tunnel` Flag

- **Purpose**: Routes connections through Expo's servers instead of direct local
  network
- **When to use**:
  - Corporate firewalls blocking local connections
  - Complex network configurations (VPNs, restricted WiFi)
  - Unable to connect physical device to development server
- **Trade-off**: Slower than local connections but more reliable
- **Usage**: `yarn start --tunnel`

#### `--clear` Flag

- **Purpose**: Clears Metro bundler cache and temporary files
- **When to use**:
  - Experiencing unexplained build errors
  - Code changes not reflecting in app
  - After installing new dependencies
  - Strange bundling or transformation issues
- **Usage**: `yarn start --clear`

#### Common Network Issues

- **Corporate/University Networks**: Often require `--tunnel` due to firewall
  restrictions
- **Multiple Network Interfaces**: May need `--tunnel` if your machine has
  multiple network adapters
- **Cache Corruption**: Use `--clear` if seeing outdated code or bundle errors
- **Expo Go Connection**: If QR code scanning fails, try `--tunnel` for more
  reliable connection

For more information, see
[Expo CLI documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/) and
[Expo troubleshooting guide](https://docs.expo.dev/troubleshooting/).

### 6.5. Code Quality Standards

The codebase follows strict quality standards:

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with strict configuration
- **ESLint**: Airbnb configuration with React Native specific rules
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **File Size Limit**: All files kept under 500 lines for AI tool compatibility
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with single
  responsibility principle
- **Centralized Logging**: Use `@utils/logger.ts` for all logging operations
