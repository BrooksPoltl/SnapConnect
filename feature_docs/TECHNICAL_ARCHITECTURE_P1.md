# Technical Architecture: SnapConnect Messenger

- **Version**: 2.0
- **Author**: Gemini Architect + AI Implementation
- **Status**: Updated with AI Features

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the technical architecture for the SnapConnect Messenger
application. The backend is built on the Supabase platform with **AI-powered 
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities**, providing a scalable, 
secure, and real-time foundation for a mobile-first social messenger with 
intelligent financial insights.

The architecture prioritizes a secure-by-default posture using Row Level
Security (RLS) and efficient data management for the application's core
requirement of ephemeral content and AI-powered financial analysis.

This design covers the foundational features: User Authentication, Profiles,
Friend Management, Real-Time Chat, Ephemeral Stories (Photo & Video), and 
**AI Chat with RAG Integration**.

## 2. Technology Stack

The backend leverages the following integrated services:

### Core Platform (Supabase)
- **Supabase Auth**: For user sign-up, login, and JWT-based session management.
- **Supabase Database (Postgres)**: The primary relational database for storing
  all application data, including user profiles, relationships, message
  metadata, and **AI conversation data**.
- **Supabase Storage**: For storing all user-generated media (photos and videos
  for messages and stories).
- **Supabase Realtime**: For broadcasting and receiving chat messages instantly.
- **Supabase Edge Functions**: For scheduled server-side tasks,
  specifically for data cleanup.

### AI Infrastructure
- **Node.js TypeScript API**: Custom API endpoint for RAG functionality
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: Language model for generating financial insights
- **Pinecone Vector Database**: Vector storage and similarity search for EDGAR filings
- **SEC EDGAR Data**: Corporate filings providing financial context for AI responses

## 3. Database Schema

## 4. Core Backend Logic

### 4.1. Security Model: Row Level Security (RLS)

The system is secure by default. RLS is enabled on all tables, and access is
granted only through explicit policies.

- **Authentication**: All policies rely on `auth.uid()` to identify the current
  user from their JWT.
- **Ownership**: Users can only update or delete records they own (e.g., their
  own profile).
- **Relationship-Based Access**: Access to shared content like `messages` and
  `friendships` is granted only if the requesting user is a valid participant.
- **Example (`stories` SELECT Policy)**: A user can see a story if
  `story.created_at` is within 24 hours AND (`story.privacy` is 'public' OR the
  user is an accepted friend of `story.author_id`). For private `messages`, a
  similar policy will grant access only if the message has not yet been viewed,
  or if it has been viewed within the last 24 hours (i.e.,
  `now() - viewed_at < '24 hours'::interval`).
- **Storage Access**: Policies on the `storage.objects` table ensure that users
  can only upload to designated buckets (e.g., `media`) and can only access
  media objects if they have a corresponding record in the `messages` or
  `stories` table that they are authorized to view.

### 4.2. Content Expiration: Hybrid TTL Model

A two-part system ensures content disappears reliably and the system remains
performant.

1.  **Instant Invisibility**: RLS policies on `messages` and `stories` prevent
    users from selecting any expired rows. This provides the exact user
    experience of content disappearing on time.
    - For `stories`, policies hide rows where `created_at` is older than 24
      hours.
    - For private `messages`, policies hide rows where `viewed_at` is not null
      and is older than 24 hours. Unread messages remain visible indefinitely
      until read.
2.  **Permanent Deletion**: A scheduled Supabase Edge Function (`daily_cleanup`)
    runs once per day to permanently delete data and associated files from
    Storage that are older than 24 hours. This prevents data accumulation and
    keeps storage costs manageable.
    - The job deletes `stories` where `created_at` is older than 24 hours.
    - The job also deletes `messages` where `viewed_at` is not null and is older
      than 24 hours.

### 4.3. User Score Logic

The user score is updated automatically using Postgres triggers for maximum
efficiency.

- **On `messages` Insert**: A trigger executes a database function
  (`update_user_score(sender_id, 5)`).
- **On `stories` Insert**: A trigger executes the same function
  (`update_user_score(author_id, 10)`).
- The `update_user_score` function runs with `SECURITY DEFINER` permissions to
  atomically update the `score` in the `profiles` table.

### 4.4. Real-Time Chat

- **Broadcasting**: When a message is inserted, a database trigger or the
  backend service will send the new message payload to a Supabase Realtime
  channel.
- **Channels**: Channel names are specific to a conversation (e.g., `chat:123`).
- **Subscribing**: The client application subscribes to the relevant channels to
  receive messages instantly without needing to poll the database.

### 4.5. AI-Powered RAG System

The AI system provides financial insights through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.

#### Architecture Components:
1. **Vector Database (Pinecone)**: Stores embeddings of SEC filing content for similarity search
2. **Node.js API Endpoint**: Handles RAG queries with context retrieval and AI generation
3. **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-4o-mini for generating contextual financial insights
4. **Conversation Persistence**: Automatically saves user queries and AI responses

#### RAG Process Flow:
1. **User Query**: User sends financial question via chat interface
2. **Context Retrieval**: Query is embedded and used to search Pinecone for relevant SEC filing content
3. **Context Augmentation**: Retrieved filing excerpts are combined with user query
4. **AI Generation**: OpenAI generates response using retrieved context and financial expertise
5. **Response Delivery**: AI response is returned to user and saved to conversation history
6. **Sharing Options**: Users can share AI responses to feeds or send to friends

#### Security & RLS for AI Tables:
- **ai_conversations**: Users can only access their own conversations
- **ai_messages**: Messages are filtered by conversation ownership
- **ai_posts**: Public posts visible to all, friend posts visible to accepted friends only

## 5. Server-Side Components

### 5.1. Database Functions

#### Core Functions
- **`function update_user_score(user_id uuid, points integer)`**: A reusable
  `pl/pgsql` function that safely increments a user's score.
- **`function suggest_users(user_id uuid, count integer)`**: Returns a set of
  random users that the given `user_id` is not already friends with.
- **`function send_media_to_friends(storage_path text, content_type text, recipient_ids uuid[])`**:
  Handles the transactional sending of a media message to multiple recipients.
  It iterates through the recipient IDs, finds or creates a direct chat for
  each, and inserts the message metadata into the `messages` table. This is
  invoked via RPC from the client.

#### AI Functions
- **`function get_user_ai_conversations(user_uuid uuid)`**: Returns all AI conversations
  for a user with metadata including message count and last activity timestamp.
- **`function get_ai_conversation_messages(conv_id uuid)`**: Fetches all messages
  for a specific AI conversation, ordered chronologically.
- **`function update_ai_conversation_title(conv_id uuid, new_title text)`**: Allows
  users to update the title of their AI conversations.
- **`function create_ai_conversation(user_uuid uuid, title text)`**: Creates a new
  AI conversation with optional custom title.
- **`function add_ai_message(conv_id uuid, sender_type text, content text)`**: Adds
  messages (user or AI) to conversations with validation.
- **`function get_public_feed(limit_count integer, offset_count integer)`**: Returns
  paginated public AI posts with user profile information.
- **`function get_friend_feed(user_uuid uuid, limit_count integer, offset_count integer)`**:
  Returns paginated AI posts from user's accepted friends.
- **`function create_ai_post(user_uuid uuid, user_commentary text, ai_response text, source_url text, privacy_setting text)`**:
  Creates new AI posts for sharing insights to feeds.

### 5.2. Edge Functions

- **`function daily-cleanup()`**: A Deno function scheduled via `pg_cron`.
  - **Trigger**: Runs on a schedule (e.g., daily at midnight).
  - **Action**:
    1. Queries for all `messages` and `stories` with a `created_at` older than
       24 hours.
    2. Extracts the `storage_path` from each record.
    3. Issues commands to Supabase Storage to delete the files at those paths.
    4. Deletes the records from the database tables.

## 6. API & Client Interaction

(High-Level view, as frontend is not in scope)

The client application will interact with the backend primarily through the
Supabase client libraries (`supabase-js`).

- **Auth**: Use `supabase.auth.signUp()` and
  `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()`.
- **Data**: Use `supabase.from('table').select/insert/update/delete()` to
  interact with data. RLS policies will automatically filter results.
- **Realtime**: Use `supabase.channel('channel-name').subscribe()` to listen for
  events.
- **Functions**: Use `supabase.functions.invoke()` to call Edge Functions if any
  client-invokable functions are needed in the future.
