### Phone Authentication Feature Plan

| Priority | Task Description | Implementation Details | Code Pointers | Dependencies | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High** | **Backend: Configure Supabase Auth** | Enable Phone Authentication in the Supabase dashboard. Configure the SMS provider (e.g., Twilio) with the necessary credentials. This is a manual step in the Supabase project settings. Note that SMS providers like Twilio are paid services. | `Supabase Dashboard` -> `Authentication` -> `Providers` -> `Phone` | None | Not Started |
| **High** | **Frontend: Update `PhoneAuthScreen` UI** | Replace the "Coming Soon" placeholder with a `TextInput` for the phone number and a button to trigger the sign-in process. We will need to manage two states: one for entering the phone number and another for verifying the OTP. We can use `react-native-phone-number-input` for a user-friendly country code selector. | `src/screens/PhoneAuthScreen/index.tsx` | `react-native-phone-number-input` package | Not Started |
| **High** | **Frontend: Implement Phone Sign-in Logic** | Create a `signInWithPhone` function in the auth service. This function will call `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp` with the user's phone number. It should handle both sending the initial OTP and verifying it. | `src/services/auth.ts` | Backend Config | Not Started |
| **Medium**| **Frontend: Implement OTP Verification Logic** | Add a `verifyPhoneOtp` function to the auth service. This will take the phone number and OTP code and call `supabase.auth.verifyOtp`. On success, the user will be logged in. | `src/services/auth.ts` | `signInWithPhone` | Not Started |
| **Medium**| **Frontend: Handle New User Onboarding** | After a new user successfully verifies their phone number, check if they have a profile. If not, navigate them to a "Create Profile" screen to enter their username and full name. | `src/navigation/AuthStack.tsx`, `PhoneAuthScreen` | OTP Verification | Not Started |
| **Low** | **Frontend: Refactor Email Dependencies** | Update the `ConversationScreen` to use a more generic fallback than `user.email`. Adjust the `getUserProfile` service to gracefully handle users without an email. | `src/screens/ConversationScreen/index.tsx`, `src/services/user.ts` | None | Not Started |
| **Low** | **Frontend: Add Error Handling** | Implement user-friendly error alerts for common issues like invalid phone numbers, incorrect OTPs, or network errors, using the application's standard error display method. | `src/screens/PhoneAuthScreen/index.tsx` | Sign-in/OTP Logic | Not Started |
