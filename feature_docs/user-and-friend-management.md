### Feature Plan: User Profile & Friend Management

This document outlines the tasks required to build user profiles and friend
management features, with a strong emphasis on backend-enforced security.

## Security Architecture Overview

**Core Principle: Never Trust the Client**

All security is enforced on the Supabase backend through Row Level Security
(RLS) policies. The client-side code can be inspected and modified by users, but
this poses no security risk because:

1. **The `anon key` is intentionally public** - It only identifies which
   Supabase project to connect to and has zero special privileges. All requests
   using this key are subject to RLS policies.

2. **The `service_role key` is never exposed** - This admin key that bypasses
   RLS is only used in secure server environments and never bundled with the
   client app.

3. **Database migrations require developer credentials** - Migrations are run
   via Supabase CLI using separate, authenticated developer tokens, not the
   public anon key.

4. **RLS policies are the enforcement layer** - These SQL rules run on the
   server and cannot be bypassed by client modifications. Examples:
   - Users can only update their own `username`, never their `score`
   - Friend requests can only be accepted by the intended recipient
   - Users can only see content they have permission to access

- **`stories` table**: Story posts with privacy controls and 24-hour TTL
- **RLS Policies**: Comprehensive security policies for all tables
- **Database Functions**: Secure RPC functions for user management, friend requests, and scoring

## Key Implementation Decisions & Learnings

### 1. Transaction Safety in User Signup
**Challenge**: Ensuring both auth user creation and profile creation succeed together.

**Solution**: Implemented atomic user creation using Supabase RPC function:
- Pre-validate username availability before creating auth user
- Use `create_user_profile(user_id, username, score)` RPC function for atomic profile creation
- Comprehensive input validation (length, characters, uniqueness) at database level
- Graceful error handling with clear user feedback

**Code**: `src/services/auth.ts` + `supabase/migrations/20241223000001_...`

### 2. Security-First Architecture
**Approach**: All security enforced at database level, never trust client code.

**Implementation**:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- `SECURITY DEFINER` functions for privileged operations
- Public `anon` key with zero special privileges
- Server-side validation for all critical operations

### 3. Modular Service Architecture
**Structure**: Clean separation of concerns across services:
- `auth.ts`: User authentication and account management
- `user.ts`: User profile operations and search
- `friends.ts`: Friend management and social features
- Each service handles its own error logging and type safety

### 4. Comprehensive Database Design
**Features**:
- Automatic profile creation triggers
- Score increment triggers for engagement
- Friend suggestion algorithms
- 24-hour TTL for ephemeral content
- Optimized indexes for performance

## Current Status: ✅ FEATURE COMPLETE
