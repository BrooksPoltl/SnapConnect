## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. Race Condition in Chat Store Real-time Subscriptions
**File:** `src/stores/chatStore.ts:88-121`  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Issue:** Multiple rapid calls to `initializeRealtime()` can create multiple subscriptions without proper cleanup, leading to duplicate event handlers and memory leaks.

```typescript
// Problem: No check if initialization is already in progress
initializeRealtime: (user: User) => {
  const { cleanup, refreshUnreadCount, refreshConversations } = get();
  cleanup(); // This might not complete before new subscription starts
  const channel = supabase.channel(`chat:${user.id}`);
```

**Impact:** Memory leaks, duplicate real-time events, degraded performance  
**Fix:** Add initialization state tracking and proper async cleanup

### 2. Authentication Hook Race Condition
**File:** `src/utils/hooks/useAuthentication.ts:32-57`  
**Issue:** The `fetchUserData` function can be called multiple times concurrently, potentially causing state inconsistencies.

```typescript
// Problem: No concurrency control
const fetchUserData = async (userId: string) => {
  try {
    const fetchedUserData = await getUserData(userId);
    setUserData(fetchedUserData); // This can override newer data
```

**Impact:** Inconsistent user state, potential data races  
**Fix:** Implement request cancellation and concurrency control

### 3. Camera Recording State Inconsistency
**File:** `src/screens/CameraScreen/index.tsx:186-205`  
**Issue:** The recording state is set to `true` before `recordAsync()` is called, but if `recordAsync()` throws immediately, state is not reset in the catch block.

```typescript
setIsRecording(true);
const video = await cameraRef.current.recordAsync(); // Can throw immediately
// If this throws, isRecording stays true forever
```

**Impact:** UI becomes permanently stuck in recording state  
**Fix:** Move `setIsRecording(true)` after successful recording start or add proper state reset

### 4. Supabase Client Potential Memory Leak
**File:** `src/services/supabase.ts:17-26`  
**Issue:** Real-time subscriptions created by the Supabase client may not be properly cleaned up on app termination.

**Impact:** Memory leaks, zombie connections  
**Fix:** Implement proper cleanup in app lifecycle hooks

---

## üü° MEDIUM SEVERITY ISSUES

### 5. Inconsistent Error Handling in Media Upload
**File:** `src/services/media.ts:45-52`  
**Issue:** Error handling is inconsistent - some errors are re-thrown as-is, others are wrapped.

```typescript
if (error instanceof Error) {
  throw error; // Re-throws original
}
throw new Error('An unknown error occurred during media upload.'); // Creates new error
```

**Impact:** Inconsistent error messages, difficult debugging  
**Fix:** Standardize error handling pattern across all services

### 6. Missing Input Validation in Chat Functions
**File:** `src/services/chat.ts:96-110`  
**Issue:** `getChatMessages` doesn't validate that `limit` parameter is positive or reasonable.

```typescript
export async function getChatMessages(chatId: number, limit: number = 50): Promise<Message[]> {
  // No validation: limit could be negative, zero, or extremely large
```

**Impact:** Potential performance issues, database overload  
**Fix:** Add input validation for all service function parameters

### 7. Story Deletion Cleanup Race Condition
**File:** `src/services/stories.ts:83-106`  
**Issue:** If database deletion succeeds but storage deletion fails, the user sees success but file remains orphaned.

```typescript
// Storage cleanup happens after DB record is deleted
const { error: storageError } = await supabase.storage.from('media').remove([storagePath]);
if (storageError) {
  // Only logs error, doesn't inform user
  logger.error('Error deleting story object from storage:', {
```

**Impact:** Orphaned files, storage bloat, user confusion  
**Fix:** Implement proper cleanup sequence or transaction-like behavior

### 8. Username Update Security Gap
**File:** `src/services/user.ts:157-172`  
**Issue:** No client-side validation before calling the backend function for username updates.

**Impact:** Unnecessary backend calls, poor user experience  
**Fix:** Add client-side validation (length, characters, uniqueness check)

### 9. Chat Store Subscription Memory Leak
**File:** `src/stores/chatStore.ts:111-120`  
**Issue:** If component unmounts during subscription setup, the subscription remains active.

**Impact:** Memory leaks, potential app crashes  
**Fix:** Implement cleanup in useEffect cleanup functions

## üü¢ LOW PRIORITY ISSUES

### 10. Missing TypeScript Strict Null Checks
**File:** Multiple files  
**Issue:** Some functions don't handle null/undefined cases explicitly.

**Example:** `src/services/user.ts:35-45`
```typescript
// Should explicitly handle null userData
const userData: UserData = {
  id: profile.id,
  username: profile.username,
  score: profile.score ?? 0, // Good null handling here
  // But missing checks for profile.id, profile.username
```

**Fix:** Enable strict null checks in TypeScript config and fix violations

### 11. Hardcoded Configuration Values
**File:** `src/services/media.ts:71`  
**Issue:** Hardcoded expiration time for signed URLs.

```typescript
expiresIn: number = 60, // Hardcoded 60 seconds
```

**Fix:** Move to configuration file or environment variables

### 12. Missing Loading States in UI Components
**File:** Various screens  
**Issue:** Some async operations don't show loading states to users.

**Fix:** Add loading indicators for all async operations

### 13. TODO Comments in Production Code
**File:** `src/screens/AIChatScreen/index.tsx:152, 156, 166-167`  
**Issue:** Multiple TODO comments indicate incomplete functionality.

**Fix:** Complete implementation or create proper issues to track
