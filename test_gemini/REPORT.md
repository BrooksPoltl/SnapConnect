# SnapConnect Code Analysis Report

This report details potential issues found in the SnapConnect codebase, based on
the rules defined in `GEMINI.md`.

---

## Root Directory Files

### `App.tsx`

- **Styling**: Inline styles are used, which should be moved to a separate
  `styles.ts` file for better maintainability and consistency. (Rule 3)
- **Error Handling**: The root component `App` is not wrapped in an Error
  Boundary, which can lead to the entire app crashing on rendering errors.
  (Rule 1)
- **Accessibility**: Accessibility props like `accessibilityLabel` are missing
  from interactive elements, which is crucial for screen reader support.
  (Rule 3)

### `eslint.config.js`

- **Linting**: The ESLint configuration appears to be missing React
  Native-specific plugins (e.g., `@react-native-community/eslint-config`). This
  could lead to inconsistent coding styles and potential bugs specific to the
  React Native environment. (Rule 2)

### `package.json`

- **Scripts**: There is no dedicated `lint` script. Adding a linting script
  would make it easier to enforce code quality checks across the project.
  (Rule 2)

### `tsconfig.json`

- **Configuration**: The TypeScript configuration is well-aligned with the
  project's best practices, with `"strict": true` enabled.

## `src/components` Directory

### `AuthButton`

- **Props**: The `AuthButton` component does not destructure its props, which
  goes against the established code style. (Rule 3)
- **Accessibility**: The `TouchableOpacity` component is missing an
  `accessibilityRole` prop, which should be set to `"button"` to improve screen
  reader support. (Rule 3)

### `CameraControls`

- **Performance**: The functions passed to the `onPress` props of the
  `TouchableOpacity` components are not wrapped in `useCallback`, which could
  lead to unnecessary re-renders. (Rule 3)
- **Accessibility**: The interactive icons within the controls are missing
  `accessibilityLabel` props, making them inaccessible to screen reader users.
  (Rule 3)

### `CameraOptions`

- **Performance**: The component uses inline arrow functions for `onPress`
  handlers, which can cause unnecessary re-renders. These should be memoized
  with `useCallback`. (Rule 3)
- **Accessibility**: The `TouchableOpacity` components are missing
  `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityRole` props, making them difficult for
  screen reader users to navigate. (Rule 3)

### `CameraPermissionStatus`

- **Component Granularity**: The component contains a significant amount of
  conditional rendering logic. This could be simplified by breaking it down into
  smaller, more focused sub-components for each permission status (e.g.,
  `PermissionGranted`, `PermissionDenied`). (Rule 3)
- **Styling**: The component uses inline styles, which should be moved to a
  separate `styles.ts` file. (Rule 3)

### `ConversationListItem`

- **Props**: The component does not destructure its props, which is inconsistent
  with the project's coding style. (Rule 3)
- **Performance**: The `onPress` handler is an inline function, which can lead
  to performance issues. It should be memoized using `useCallback`. (Rule 3)
- **Accessibility**: The `TouchableOpacity` component is missing both
  `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityRole` props, making it inaccessible to
  users relying on screen readers. (Rule 3)

### `DisclaimerText`

- **Styling**: The component uses inline styles, which should be extracted to a
  separate `styles.ts` file to maintain consistency with the project's styling
  conventions. (Rule 3)

### `FormField`

- **Props**: The component does not destructure its props, which is inconsistent
  with the project's coding style. (Rule 3)
- **Accessibility**: The `TextInput` component is missing an
  `accessibilityLabel` prop, which is important for screen reader users.
  (Rule 3)

### `HomeScreenAnimatedText`

- **Props**: The component does not destructure its props, which is inconsistent
  with the project's coding style. (Rule 3)
- **Performance**: The animation uses the native driver, which is good, but the
  component itself is not wrapped in `React.memo`, which could prevent
  unnecessary re-renders. (Rule 3)

### `Icon`

- **TypeScript**: The component uses `any` to bypass a type issue with
  `react-native-vector-icons`. While a comment explains the reasoning, this is a
  workaround and could hide potential type errors. (Rule 2)

### `PhotoPreview`

- **Props**: The component does not destructure its props, which is inconsistent
  with the project's coding style. (Rule 3)
- **Accessibility**: The `Image` component is missing an `accessibilityLabel`
  prop, which should describe the image content for screen reader users.
  (Rule 3)

### `ReturnButton`

- No issues found. The component adheres to all the best practices outlined in
  `GEMINI.md`.

---

## `src/screens` Directory

### `AddFriendScreen`

- **Error Handling**: The `handleAddFriend` function is missing a `try-catch`
  block to handle potential errors from the `addFriend` service call. (Rule 1)
- **Logging**: The `addFriend` service call is not logged, which makes it
  difficult to debug issues related to adding friends. (Rule 1)
- **Accessibility**: The `TextInput` is missing an `accessibilityLabel`, and the
  `Button` is missing an `accessibilityHint` to clarify its action. (Rule 3)

### `CameraScreen`

- **Component Granularity**: The `CameraScreen` component is large and handles
  multiple responsibilities, including camera initialization, permissions, and
  UI rendering. This could be broken down into smaller, more manageable
  components. (Rule 3)
- **Error Handling**: The `takePicture` function does not have any error
  handling, which could lead to a crash if the picture-taking process fails.
  (Rule 1)
- **Logging**: There is no logging for camera-related actions, such as taking a
  picture or switching cameras, which would be valuable for debugging. (Rule 1)

### `ChatScreen`

- **Real-time**: The component sets up a real-time subscription for messages but
  does not properly clean it up in a `useEffect` return function. This will
  cause memory leaks. (Rule 5)
- **Error Handling**: The `handleSendMessage` function is missing a `try-catch`
  block to handle potential errors from the `sendMessage` service call. (Rule 1)
- **Logging**: The `sendMessage` service call is not logged, which makes
  debugging message-related issues difficult. (Rule 1)
- **Accessibility**: The message `TextInput` is missing an `accessibilityLabel`,
  and the send `Button` lacks an `accessibilityHint`. (Rule 3)
